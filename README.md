# OpenCV with Python
This repository contains the code for OpenCV with Python. OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. It is developed by Intel and many more contributors.

## 1. Installation
### 1.1. Install OpenCV Contrib
```bash
$ pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

### 1.2 Install Matplotlib
```bash
$ pip install matplotlib
```

### 1.3 Install Tensorflow
```bash
$ pip install tensorflow
```

### 1.4 Install Caer
[**`Caer`**](https://github.com/jasmcaus/caer/) is a *lightweight, high-performance* Vision library for high-performance AI research. It simplifies your approach towards Computer Vision by abstracting away unnecessary boilerplate code giving you the **flexibility** to quickly prototype deep learning models and research ideas.
```
bash 
$ pip install caer
```

### 1.4 Install canaro
```
bash
$ pip install caer canaro
```

## 2. Basic Concepts
- Reading Images and Videos
- Resizing and Rescaling Images and Videos Frames
- Drawing Shapes and Placing Text on Images
- 5 Essential Functions in OpenCV (Grayscaling, Blurring, Edge Detection, Dilating, Eroding)
- Image Transformations (Translation, Rotation, Resizing, Flipping, Cropping)
- Contour Detection

## 3. Advanced Concepts
- Switching between Color Spaces (BGR, Grayscale, HSV, L*a*b*, RGB)
- Splitting and Merging Color Channels
- Blurring Images (Averaging, Gaussian, Median, Bilateral)
- Bitwise Operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
- Masking Images
- Histogram Computation
- Thresholding/Binarizing Images
- Adaptive Thresholding

## 4. Face Detection and Recognition
- Face Detection using Haar Cascades
- Face Recognition using OpenCV's LBPHFaceRecognizer algorithm (Local Binary Patterns Histograms)

## 5. Capstone Project - The Simpsons Characters Recognition
- Building a Simpsons Characters Recognition model using OpenCV and Deep Learning
